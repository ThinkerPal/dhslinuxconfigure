# linuxconfigs

Hello! This is a repo where I put a bunch of linux config files to quickly setup a Linux Environment! Scripts are mostly for Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 (Bionic Beaver and Focal Fossia), with more to come!

You may feel free to remove the lines where I use my own sources - depending on where you are, they may not be the best servers to pull from :)
